Hello! I'm a [Physical Scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/sarah-y-murphy) & a Virtual Conference Specialist and Editor for The Conference Exchange.

This GitHub account was primarily used for work during my Ph.D. at Washington State University and is now mostly just a home for my [personal website](https://sarahymurphy.github.io) and hobby code. I have switched over to an internal USGS GitLab account for my code; all public code releases will be listed on my website.
